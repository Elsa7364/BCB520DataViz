Breaking bad: When does polycentricity lead to maladaptation rather than adaptation?,Case Study,"This article analyzes how polycentric governance structures can lead to either adaptive or maladaptive outcomes in water management systems. Through a comparative case study of New York City and Flint, Michigan's water systems, it examines how structural features of polycentricity must be combined with functional effectiveness to achieve positive outcomes.

The research analyzes relationships between 21 governmental and 2 non-governmental water-related institutions in Kherameh county to determine the governance regime and assess coordination between institutions. The findings revealed an unstable network structure with low cooperation between institutions and high power centralization.,"This is classified as a Case Study because it focuses on detailed examination of a specific instance (Kor River basin governance) to understand a broader phenomenon (water governance systems). The research uses social network analysis to deeply analyze one particular case rather than conducting broader empirical research across multiple sites or developing theoretical frameworks. The study's scope, methods, and detailed analysis of a single governance system clearly align with case study methodology.",Structural_characteristics_of_,,,
The Politics of Adaptive Governance: Water Reform and Climate Change in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin,Case Study,"This paper analyzes 558 recommendations from 34 water reform reviews and inquiries in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin to examine how competing problem-solving logics enable or constrain adaptive water governance. The study finds that administrative and techno-rationalist approaches dominate reform efforts, limiting transformation toward more adaptive governance needed to address climate change and First Nations' water justice.","This is classified as a Case Study because it provides an in-depth examination of a specific governance system (Australia's Murray-Darling Basin) through analysis of historical documents to understand how different governance logics influence adaptation and transformation. While it involves empirical analysis of recommendations, its primary contribution is using this single case to develop theoretical insights about adaptive governance rather than testing hypotheses across multiple cases or purely advancing theory.","The politics of adaptive governance water reform, climate change, and First",,,
Understanding Power Dynamics in Water Governance Collaboration,Case Study,"This study analyzes how power dynamics shaped collaboration and social learning during the development of the Lockyer Valley Catchment Action Plan in Queensland, Australia. Through 25 stakeholder interviews, the research identifies three main 'power hubs' that influenced governance outcomes: power of facilitation, power of trust, and power of politics. The study demonstrates how instrumental, structural, and discursive power dynamics affected stakeholder collaboration and learning processes.",This should be classified as a Case Study because it:1. Focuses on a specific real-world example (Lockyer Valley Catchment Action Plan)2. Uses interviews to collect detailed data about a particular situation3. Analyzes a bounded system/event to understand complex dynamics4. Aims to provide in-depth understanding of a specific context5. Does not test hypotheses or develop new theory as would be expected in empirical or theoretical research,Understanding the complex power dynamics that shape collaboration and,,,
Multi-level water governance ‚Äì the case of the Morsa River Basin in Norway,Case Study,"This paper examines the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in Norway's Morsa River Basin, analyzing how a multi-level network organization managed water resources across municipal borders. The study explores how the Morsa network achieved collective action and democratic legitimacy through bioregional management, polycentric governance, public participation, and knowledge-based approaches.","This is clearly a Case Study because it provides an in-depth examination of a specific instance (Morsa River Basin) to understand how multi-level water governance works in practice. The paper uses interviews and documentary evidence to analyze a single case over time, examining how different governance approaches were implemented and their outcomes. While it includes theoretical context, the focus is on understanding this particular case rather than testing theories or conducting empirical research across multiple cases.",uploads_MLGP Library_Useful Documents_English_L383 Morsa River Basin ,,,
IWRM through WFD Implementation? Drivers for Integration in Polycentric Water Governance Systems,Empirical Research,"This study examines what motivates the adoption of integrated water resources management by analyzing local implementation cases of the EU Water Framework Directive across five German federal states. The research found that policy implementers attempt integration based on incentives for reaching goals rather than paradigms, with integration of different actors occurring at different planning phases depending on power relations. The WFD itself was not found to be a direct driver for local integration but did induce more integrated management through setting goals.","This is classified as Empirical Research because it uses primary data collection through interviews, participant observation, and document analysis to systematically study real-world implementation cases. The methodology focuses on gathering empirical evidence through semi-structured interviews with 54 planners and decision-makers, complemented by participatory observation. The analysis is based on concrete cases and actual practices rather than theoretical frameworks or literature review.",water-11-01063-v2,,,
Water Governance Research in a Messy World: A Review,Review & Synthesis,"A comprehensive review examining how water governance research has engaged with the complexity ('messiness') of real-world water management. The article analyzes three main aspects: scalar complexity, institutional diversity, and multiple meanings/practices. It explores how mainstream policy approaches tend to oversimplify these complexities and discusses alternative critical research perspectives.","This is clearly a Review & Synthesis paper based on several key factors: 1) It explicitly states it is a review in both the title and abstract, 2) It systematically examines and synthesizes existing literature rather than presenting new empirical research, 3) It integrates multiple theoretical perspectives and bodies of literature to develop a framework for understanding water governance research, and 4) It aims to lay groundwork for future dialogue between mainstream and critical approaches.",Whaley - 2022 - Water Governance Research in a Messy World A Revi,,,
