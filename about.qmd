I'm Marwa Elsayed, a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of Idaho, with a background in Public Administration and Tour Guidance. My research focuses on policy analysis, water governance, and data-driven decision-making. I'm interested in data visualization, political research methods, and using computational tools for public policy.

Outside of academia, I love lifting, climbing, and electronic music.
