    "text": "For this assignment, I’m doing a visualization with Anscombe’s Quartet—a very interesting dataset that shows how important it is to actually see our data, not just look at the stats. It is named after Frank Anscombe, t he one who designed the dataset in 1973 to teach this lesson.\nThe dataset consists of four groups of x and y values that share almost identical summary statistics (mean, variance, and correlation) but look so different when plotted. I’ll create two visualizations, one straightforward and coded by hand, and another with a little help from AI to make it more playful and polished."

    "text": "Assignment: Data Visualization using Reddit Hyperlink Network\nFor this assignment, I’m creating a data visualization using the Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset from Stanford’s SNAP (source). This dataset tracks how different subreddits are connected through hyperlinks—basically, when one subreddit links to another in a post.\nI picked the second dataset to analyze subreddit interactions based on title mentions rather than mentions in in posts for simplicity. I’m using Social Network Analysis (SNA) to explore how communities interact and connect on Reddit. The goal is to visualize these relationships and see patterns in how subreddits reference each other!\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\nfile_path &lt;- \"C:/Github repos/soc-redditHyperlinks-title.tsv\"\n\n# using read_tsv to read the data without needing to decompress it\nreddit_data &lt;- read_tsv(file_path, comment = \"#\")\n\nRows: 571927 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \"\\t\"\nchr  (4): SOURCE_SUBREDDIT, TARGET_SUBREDDIT, POST_ID, PROPERTIES\ndbl  (1): LINK_SENTIMENT\ndttm (1): TIMESTAMP\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(reddit_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  SOURCE_SUBREDDIT  TARGET_SUBREDDIT POST_ID TIMESTAMP           LINK_SENTIMENT\n  &lt;chr&gt;
